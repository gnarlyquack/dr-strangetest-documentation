This wiki provides a more illustrative walkthrough of how EasyTest works and
its features than is provided in the
[README](https://github.com/gnarlyquack/easytest), which offers "Just the
Facts". Although every effort is made to keep this wiki up-to-date, the README
will always have the most current information.

For the "full tutorial" experience, I recommend going through the pages in the
following order:

1. [Writing Tests](https://github.com/gnarlyquack/easytest/wiki/Writing-Tests)
   will get you up and running with EasyTest and tell you everything you need
   to know about writing tests.
2. [Test Fixtures](https://github.com/gnarlyquack/easytest/wiki/Test-Fixtures)
   explains how EasyTest lets you to manage your tests' state.
3. [Writing
   Assertions](https://github.com/gnarlyquack/easytest/wiki/Writing-Assertions)
   provides a comprehensive example on how to implement your own assertion if
   EasyTest doesn't provide the assertion you want and/or using PHP's
   `assert()` is impractical.

Please open an issue and (ideally) contribute a fix if you find an error in
these pages!
