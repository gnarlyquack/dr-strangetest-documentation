Every little bit helps, so contributions are greatly welcome and much appreciated. The lifeblood of open source is the involvement of community, and this project endeavors to encourage and respect all contributions as well as their contributors.</p><p>Some of the ways in which you can contribute are listed below.</p><h3>Promote the Project to Others</h3><p>If you like Dr. Strangetest and find it useful, let others know! Whether through verbal recommendation, a shout-out on social media, or a write-up on your blog, spreading the word can go a long way towards helping build and grow the community.</p><h3>Report Bugs or Missing Features</h3><p>If you think you've found a bug in the software, please report it. Or if you think there's an important feature that's missing, feel free to make a suggestion and start a discussion. Both can be done using Dr. Strangetest's <a href="https://github.com/gnarlyquack/easytest">issue tracker</a>.</p><h3>Improve Documentation</h3><p>Documentation, it seems, is always a work in progress. If you find something that's incorrect, incomplete, out of date, or confusing, or an example is missing or could be improved, you can <a href="https://github.com/gnarlyquack/easytest">open an issue</a> to report a deficiency or suggest an improvement. Or if you have some writing chops you'd like to flex, you can update the documentation directly and submit a pull request.</p><h3>Participate in Development</h3><p>Pull requests are always welcome! Head over to <a href="https://github.com/gnarlyquack/easytest">Dr. Strangetest's source repository</a> to obtain the code. It's recommended that you make known your intention to work on an issue to avoid duplication of effort. For the same reason, if you're not working on an existing issue, it's recommended that you first open one to announce and potentially discuss the work you intend to do.</p></article></main><footer><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/80x15.png"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.</p><p>Please open an issue if you find an error in these pages.
