Contributing
============

Thank you for taking an interest in contributing to EasyTest! I appreciate
that you're thinking about contributing your time to improving the project,
and it's my goal to respect your contribution accordingly.

Although this document focuses on code contributions, you can contribute in
several ways:

-   File a bug report.

-   Add or improve documentation.

-   Promote the project to others.


Contributing Code
-----------------

-   Pick an open issue to work on.

    -   If there isn't an open issue, I recommend you first open one before
        starting so we can discuss your intended work.

-   Install EasyTest for development.

    -   Ensure your system meets the requirements listed in README.txt.

    -   Clone the repository to your computer.

    -   Change into EasyTest's root source directory and run its tests:

            ./bin/easytest

        If you encounter any errors or failures, you may have uncovered a bug!
        If this is the case, please open an issue.

-   Write your code.

    -   Create a topic branch for your work. If working on multiple issues,
        use a new branch for each issue.

    -   Your changes shouldn't break the requirements listed in README.txt.

    -   Test your work!

    -   Remember to update documentation, if necessary. Specifically:
        README.txt and CHANGELOG.txt.

-   Commit your work.

    -   Clean up your commits! Although your work need not result in a single
        commit, each commit should represent a logical change.

    -   Write a good commit message.
