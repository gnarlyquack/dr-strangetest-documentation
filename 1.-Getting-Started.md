# Requirements

EasyTest supports PHP versions 5.3 through 7.4.

For PHP 7, 'zend.assertions' must NOT be in production mode.


# Installation

## Phar (PHP Archive)

The recommended way to use EasyTest is to [download a
Phar](https://github.com/gnarlyquack/easytest/releases/latest/download/easytest.phar).
Place the Phar in the root directory of your project. Run EasyTest as follows:

    php easytest.phar

If you make the Phar executable you can run it directly:

    ./easytest.phar

Note that PHP must have the Phar extension enabled.


## Composer

Install EasyTest using Composer:

    composer require --dev easytest/easytest

Composer installs the `easytest` executable in its `bin-dir`, which defaults
to `vendor/bin`. Assuming the default `bin-dir`, run EasyTest as follows:

    ./vendor/bin/easytest


From hereon, references to `easytest` refer to the location of the executable.


# Running Tests

Run EasyTest on the command line:

  $ easytest

By default, EasyTest searches the current directory for tests. Typically you
would run EasyTest from your project's root directory and place your tests in
a file or directory in that directory. If you use Composer, EasyTest also
tries to load Composer's autoloader so your project is automatically visible
to your test suite.

You can run individual tests or a subset of tests by invoking EasyTest with
one or more paths to directories or files in your test suite.

This tests the `test_subdir` directory and `test_foo.php` file in the `tests`
directory:

    easytest tests/test_subdir tests/test_foo.php

To run specific tests within a file, use test specifiers. Function specifiers
let you test individual functions while class specifiers let you test
individual classes and methods.

This tests two functions, `test_one` and `test_two`, in the file
`test_foo.php`:

    easytest tests/test_foo.php --function=test_one,test_one

Note that function names should be fully qualified.

This tests two classes, `TestFoo` and `TestBar`, in the file `test_foo.php`:

    easytest tests/test_foo.php --class=TestFoo,TestBar

Note that class names should be fully qualified.

Methods can also be specified. This tests two methods, `testOne` and
`testTwo`, in class `TestFoo` in the file `test_foo.php`:

    easytest tests/test_foo.php --class=TestFoo::testOne,testTwo

Note that, if multiple classes are listed, method specifiers are associated
only with the last class in the list. So this tests class `TestFoo` and two
methods in class `TestBar`:

    easytest tests/test_foo.php --class=TestFoo,TestBar::testOne,testTwo

To specify methods in multiple classes, use multiple class specifiers:

    easytest tests/test_foo.php --class=TestFoo::testOne,testTwo --class=TestBar::testOne,testTwo

You can, of course, specify multiple paths with muliple specifiers for each:

    easytest tests/test_foo.php --function=test_one,test_two --class=TestFoo::testOne,testTwo tests/test_bar.php --class=TestBar --function=test_three,test_four
